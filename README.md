# AirVision üåç  

*A solution for [From EarthData to Action: Cloud Computing with Earth Observation Data for Predicting Cleaner, Safer Skies](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/challenges/from-earthdata-to-action-cloud-computing-with-earth-observation-data-for-predicting-cleaner-safer-skies)*  
Developed by **Team RandomStorm** (@Teasotea, @andrii0yerko) during the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, 4‚Äì5 October 2025.

## üåç PROJECT DETAILS  

**AirVision** is a web application that visualizes **real-time air quality** by combining **NASA TEMPO satellite data** with **ground-based OpenAQ sensor data**.  
The platform helps users understand their local air quality, receive forecasts such as *Good*, *Moderate*, or *Unhealthy*, and get alerts when pollution levels increase.

Our goal is to bridge **satellite Earth observation data** and **everyday public awareness**, transforming complex data into actionable insights for citizens, policymakers, and educators.

### ‚ú® Features  

1. **Integrated Air Quality Dashboard** ‚Äì Displays real-time PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ readings from OpenAQ alongside satellite-based pollution data from NASA TEMPO.  
2. **City-Level Search & Forecast** ‚Äì Allows users to search any city or coordinates and receive a forecast labeled ‚ÄúGood / Moderate / Unhealthy.‚Äù  
3. **Satellite‚ÄìGround Comparison View** ‚Äì Side-by-side visualization of satellite vs. ground-level measurements for data validation and context.  
4. **Health Alerts & Recommendations** ‚Äì Simple, color-coded alerts to help users make informed outdoor activity decisions.  
5. **Offline Sample Mode** ‚Äì Includes a sample dataset (`data/sample_data.json`) for instant visualization testing without API calls.

### üß† Technical Details  

We primarily use:  

- **OpenAQ API** ‚Äì Live ground sensor data (PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ).  
- **NASA TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution)** ‚Äì Column-level satellite NO‚ÇÇ and aerosol data for the North American region.  

**Core stack:**  

- `Python` + `Streamlit` ‚Äì Web app engine and UI.  
- `Prophet` ‚Äì Simple forecasting for short-term AQI prediction.  
- `Pydantic` ‚Äì Data validation layer for OpenAQ & satellite inputs.

### üß© Challenges Tackled  

1. **Data Harmonization:** Aligning units and timestamps between OpenAQ and NASA datasets.  
2. **Lightweight Architecture:** Building a demo that works both locally and in the cloud (Streamlit + REST APIs).  
3. **Usability:** Simplifying air quality indices into accessible messages and visual cues for everyday users.  
4. **Forecast Modeling:** Implementing a minimal prediction model using Prophet for AQI trends.  

---

### üöÄ Future Enhancements  

1. Add **weather data** (wind, humidity) to refine forecasts.  
2. Build **mobile alerts and notifications**.  
3. Expand **region coverage** beyond North America.  
4. Deploy scalable **cloud version (Azure/AWS)** for global use.  
5. Include **historical air quality trend visualizations**.

## ü§ñ USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  

We used **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** and **GitHub Copilot** to accelerate development and documentation.  
Forecasting was powered by **Prophet**, an open-source ML model for time series prediction.
